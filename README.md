Decorator Pattern
=================

##### A short example of the Decorator Pattern principle.
###### This was created for a quick presentation for Makers Academy week 2 sept 14'.

- A design pattern for object oriented programming
- Objects can be be given behaviours without affecting different objects within the same class.
- Essentially the existing object is being "wrapped" with additional functionality.
- To create a decorator pattern a sub class must be made within the original class which points the initialization back to it.
- Individual component methids can also point back to the
original class.
- The pattern was designed so that you can have multiple classes point back to the original class, therefore creating unique behaviours for different objects in the original class.
- Original class objects can still share similar functions.
